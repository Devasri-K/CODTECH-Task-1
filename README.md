### **Project Overview: Basic Python Calculator**

#### **Project Description**  
The goal of this project is to create a simple Python program that functions as a **basic calculator**. It allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program interacts with the user via the terminal, taking inputs, processing them, and returning the result.

#### **Features**
1. **Input Prompting**  
   - The program prompts the user to enter two numbers (**operands**) and a mathematical operation (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).

2. **Operations Supported**  
   The calculator can perform the following operations:  
   - **Addition (`+`)**: Sum of two numbers.  
   - **Subtraction (`-`)**: Difference between two numbers.  
   - **Multiplication (`*`)**: Product of two numbers.  
   - **Division (`/`)**: Quotient of two numbers with error handling for division by zero.  
   - **Modulus (`%`)**: Remainder of division between two numbers.

3. **Error Handling**  
   - Handles invalid inputs by displaying appropriate error messages.  
   - Prevents division by zero to avoid runtime errors.

4. **Output**  
   - The result of the selected operation is displayed to the user in a clear format.

#### **Code Workflow**
1. **User Input**  
   - Prompt the user to input two numbers (`operand_1` and `operand_2`).  
   - Prompt the user to choose an operation.

2. **Operation Selection**  
   - Use a conditional structure (`if-elif-else`) to determine the selected operation.

3. **Error Management**  
   - Handle invalid operations and display a user-friendly message.  
   - Prevent division by zero and ensure only valid inputs are processed.

4. **Output Result**  
   - Display the computed result or appropriate error messages to the user.

#### **Key Code Highlights**
- **Try-Except Block:** Ensures robustness by catching invalid number inputs.  
- **Conditionals:** Determines the operation and handles edge cases like division by zero.  
- **User-Friendly Output:** Results are displayed in a readable format.
